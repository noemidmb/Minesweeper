# Minesweeper
My project is Minesweeper. It is an account based game where the user must create an account in order to keep track of their wins and losses, found in the user's personal stats page. The game provides the user with the ability to customize their board's size, color, and difficulty. In addition, there is a leader board and tutorial.

To run the program, run the file TP_main.py. This file imports code from hintFeature_TP.py so that file must also be downloaded.
